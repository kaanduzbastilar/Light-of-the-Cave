## About
The game is a platform game of an adventurer. Our character in the cave tries to find 4 stones to repair the scale of his universe. Each mineral illuminates a scope of light for the character to find his path. The colors represent different themes and dynamics to set the mood of the game. The character will use each stone to his advantage and conclude his journey.
